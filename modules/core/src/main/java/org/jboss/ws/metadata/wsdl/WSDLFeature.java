/**
 * A feature component describes an abstract piece of functionality typically associated with the exchange of
 * messages between communicating parties. Although WSDL poses no constraints on the potential scope of
 * such features, examples might include "reliability", "security", "correlation", and "routing". The presence
 * of a feature component in a WSDL description indicates that the service supports the feature and may
 * require a requester agent that interacts with the service to use that feature. Each Feature is identified by its
 * URI.
