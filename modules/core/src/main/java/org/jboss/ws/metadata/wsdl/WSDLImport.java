 * The WSDL import element information item, like the include element information item (see 4.1 Including Descriptions [p.73] )
 * also allows for the separation of the different components of a WSDL description into independent descriptions,
 * but in this case with different target namespaces, which can be imported as needed. This technique helps writing
 * clearer WSDL descriptions by separating the definitions according to their level of abstraction, and maximizes reusability.
