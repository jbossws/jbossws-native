/** 
 * A policy alternative is a potentially empty collection of policy assertions. An alternative
 * with zero assertions indicates no behaviors. An alternative with one or more assertions
 * indicates behaviors implied by those, and only those assertions.
 * 
 * The vocabulary of a policy alternative is the set of all assertion types within the
 * alternative. The vocabulary of a policy is the set of all assertion types used in the policy.
 * An assertion whose type is part of the policy's vocabulary but is not included in an
 * alternative is explicitly prohibited by the alternative.
 * 
 * Assertions within an alternative are not ordered, and thus aspects such as the order in
 * which behaviors (indicated by assertions) are applied to a subject are beyond the scope
 * of this specification.
 * 
 * A policy alternative MAY contain multiple instances of an assertion type. Mechanisms for
 * determining the aggregate behavior indicated by the assertion instances (and their Post-
 * Schema-Validation Infoset (PSVI) content, if any) are specific to the assertion type.
