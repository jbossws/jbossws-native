Release Notes
=============

The project home page (http://www.jboss.org/jbossws) and the community wiki
(http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JBossWS) are usually good starting points.
They contain the User Guide and Quick Start instructions.

A list of examples that accompany the UserGuide can be found in the tests directory
that ship with the distribution.

If you have any questions, please post to the JBossWS User Forum
