Release Notes
=============

The wiki (http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossws/) is usally a good starting point.
It contains the User Guide and Quick Start instructions.

A list of examples that accompany the UserGuide can be found in the tests directory
that ship with the distribution.

If you have any questions, please post to the JBossWS User Forum
http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&op=viewforum&f=200
