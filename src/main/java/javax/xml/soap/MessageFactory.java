/**
 A factory for creating SOAPMessage objects.
 
 A SAAJ client can create a MessageFactory object using the method newInstance, as shown in the following lines of code.
 
 MessageFactory mf = MessageFactory.newInstance();
 MessageFactory mf12 = MessageFactory.newInstance(SOAPConstants.SOAP_1_2_PROTOCOL);
 
 
 All MessageFactory objects, regardless of how they are created, will produce SOAPMessage objects that have the following elements by default:
 
 * A SOAPPart object
 * A SOAPEnvelope object
 * A SOAPBody object
 * A SOAPHeader object 
 
 In some cases, specialized MessageFactory objects may be obtained that produce messages prepopulated with additional entries in the SOAPHeader object and the SOAPBody object. The content of a new SOAPMessage object depends on which of the two MessageFactory methods is used to create it.
 
 * createMessage()
 This is the method clients would normally use to create a request message.
 * createMessage(MimeHeaders, java.io.InputStream) -- message has content from the InputStream object and headers from the MimeHeaders object
 This method can be used internally by a service implementation to create a message that is a response to a request.
