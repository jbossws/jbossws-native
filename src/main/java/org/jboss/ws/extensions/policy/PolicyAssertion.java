/** 
 * A policy assertion identifies a behavior that is a requirement (or capability) of a policy
 * subject. Assertions indicate domain-specific (e.g., security, transactions) semantics and
 * are expected to be defined in separate, domain-specific specifications.
 * 
 * Assertions are strongly typed. The type is identified only by the XML Infoset
 * [namespace name] and [local name] properties (that is, the qualified name or
 * QName) of the root Element Information Item representing the assertion. Assertions of
 * a given type MUST be consistently interpreted independent of their policy subjects.
 * 
 * The XML Infoset of an assertion MAY contain a non-empty [attributes] property and/or
 * a non-empty [children] property. Such content MAY be used to parameterize the
 * behavior indicated by the assertion. For example, an assertion identifying support for a
 * specific reliable messaging mechanism might include an Attribute Information Item to
 * indicate how long an endpoint will wait before sending an acknowledgement. However,
 * additional assertion content is not required when the identity of the root Element
 * Information Item alone is enough to convey the requirement (capability).
