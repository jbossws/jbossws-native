They are meant to be used as stand alone applications: different reliable implementations are proposed for each scenario, leveraging the most suitable JBossWS features. The choices taken for the key points of each usecase are then discussed. You should follow the steps in the documentation and run the applications whenever you're invited to. This way you'll be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each solution.</para><para> </para><para>Right now the advanced sample are available in the source distribution only. You need to download it and run <emphasis>ant</emphasis> (default target) to compile everything. The advanced samples' archives (both client and server) are in the <emphasis>output/tests/lib</emphasis> directory like the other samples.</para><para> </para></section>
