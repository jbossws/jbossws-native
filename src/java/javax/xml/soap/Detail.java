/** 
   A container for DetailEntry objects. DetailEntry objects give detailed error information that is
   application-specific and related to the SOAPBody object that contains it.
   
   A Detail object, which is part of a SOAPFault object, can be retrieved using the method
   SOAPFault.getDetail. The Detail interface provides two methods. One creates a new
   DetailEntry object and also automatically adds it to the Detail object. The second method gets a
   list of the DetailEntry objects contained in a Detail object.
   
   The following code fragment, in which sf is a SOAPFault object, gets its Detail object (d), adds a
   new DetailEntry object to d, and then gets a list of all the DetailEntry objects in d. The code
   also creates a Name object to pass to the method addDetailEntry. The variable se, used to create the
   Name object, is a SOAPEnvelope object.
   
      Detail d = sf.getDetail();
      Name name = se.createName(“GetLastTradePrice”, “WOMBAT”, “http://www.wombat.org/trader”);
      d.addDetailEntry(name);
      Iterator it = d.getDetailEntries();
